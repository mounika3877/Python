Project Overview:

This project integrates the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin and Ethereum), processes the data using Python, and visualizes it through static and interactive bar charts to compare their prices and market caps. The visualization is done using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for an engaging user experience.

Key Objectives:

API Integration: Fetch real-time cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin and Ethereum) from the CoinGecko API to gain insights into market performance.
Data Processing: Clean and structure the fetched data using Python (via pandas) for easy analysis and visualization.
Data Visualization: Create clear, informative visual representations (bar charts) comparing the prices and market caps of Bitcoin and Ethereum using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Interactivity: Provide an interactive experience for users to explore and analyze the cryptocurrency data through dynamic charts (using Plotly). Technologies Used:
Python Libraries:

requests:

Purpose: To make HTTP requests to the CoinGecko API and fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.
Installation: pip install requests
pandas:

Purpose: To process, clean, and structure the fetched data into a DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Installation: pip install pandas
matplotlib:

Purpose: To create static visualizations like bar charts and line charts. It helps in displaying simple plots for the data.
Installation: pip install matplotlib
seaborn:

Purpose: To create more aesthetically pleasing and advanced visualizations. It is built on top of matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Installation: pip install seaborn
plotly:

Purpose: To create interactive visualizations and plots. It allows the creation of dynamic charts that can be zoomed, hovered over, and more.
Installation: pip install plotly
These libraries together enable seamless integration of data from external APIs, processing and visualization of the data, and providing interactive charts for enhanced user engagement.
